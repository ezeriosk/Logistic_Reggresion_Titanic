# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction with Logistic Regression

Welcome to the Titanic Survival Prediction project! This project uses logistic regression to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle. It contains information about the passengers such as age, gender, ticket class, and more.

## 📁 Files

- `log_reg_titanic.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the logistic regression model and data analysis.
- `data/`: Directory containing the Titanic dataset files.

## 📜 Project Overview

In this project, we perform the following steps:

### Data Preprocessing:
- Handle missing values
- Feature engineering
- Encoding categorical variables
- Scaling numerical features

### Model Training:
- Train a logistic regression model
- Evaluate the model using cross-validation

### Model Evaluation:
- Calculate and report accuracy

## 📈 Results

Our logistic regression model achieved the following performance:

- **Accuracy**: 0.91 (91%)
